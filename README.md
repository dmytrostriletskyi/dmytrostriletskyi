Hi, there! 👋

My name is Dmytro, I am in my mid-twenties, living in Kyiv, Ukraine. I completed Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering.
I am a T-shaped Software Engineer and Tech Lead experienced in development and operations in startups and product companies.

Not only that, but I do open source projects that solve my personal and other engineers' problems. Furthermore, I also have
Medium and Habr accounts where you can find articles in English and Russian about my projects and my thoughts about software
engineering.

I love when software engineers are passionate about their work and when they build engineering cultures with their own values.

**The latest articles in English:**

* [11 must-haves in your vacancy for software engineers](https://dmytrostriletskyi.medium.com/11-must-haves-in-your-vacancy-for-software-engineers-b9396ef24f49)
* [My experience in a self-management team](https://dmytrostriletskyi.medium.com/my-experience-in-a-self-management-team-29653ee7ada0)
